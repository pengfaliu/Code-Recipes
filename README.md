#Pengfaliu Code Recipes

Welcome to my code recipes repo! We have collected codes from mine practice enviroment,its new forever-home here at GitHub. This makes it easier for everyone to submit new recipes, contribute code and integrate all the great information into their own projects.

I hope the vast majority of code has a home here, however if you do come across any recipe that is missing, or conversely, is totally outdated and no longer relevant please submit an issue.

#What is this repo for?

This repo exists to contribute useful snippets, utility functions, and other interesting tidbits in any language that may be helpful to other developers.

Is there a master list of all the recipes?

You can find the master index of all recipes over at the Blog.

Coming Soon: www.nichad.com

#How do I submit a change or revision to a recipe?

Same as above, fork the repo and submit a PR with your change.

#What license is this code released under?

By default, all newly submitted code is licensed under the MIT license. If your recipe is being released under a different license, please make sure to include a LICENSE file inside your recipe directory.

All legacy recipes retain their original license. Please see the LICENSE file inside each recipe folder for details.
